Dataset Information:

CoQA is a Conversational Question Answering dataset released by Stanford NLP in 2019. It is a large-scale dataset for building Conversational Question Answering Systems. This dataset aims to measure the ability of machines to understand a text passage and answer a series of interconnected questions that appear in a conversation. The unique feature about this dataset is that each conversation is collected by pairing two crowd workers to chat about a passage in the form of questions and answers and hence, the questions are conversational. To understand the format of the JSON data, please refer to this link. We will be using the story, question, and answer from the JSON dataset to form our data frame.
